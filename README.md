# Oh, hi there!!!

I'm a UX Frontend Engineer who helps to turn ideas into accessible experiences.

This is the source code of my personal website. It was a fun ride that took me around 5 months on and off during my free time. During the journey I took notes of some of my major technical [Learnings](LEARNINGS.md). 

Some funny facts about it:
- All animations are CSS based powered with [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*). No libraries used.
- This is a portfolio without images or project showcase. I hope the code itself and [Codepen](https://codepen.io/sandrina-p) can make up for it.
- Designing it was way harder than implementing it!

## Run it locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install # or yarn

# Run in dev mode
npm run dev # or yarn dev

# Run tests
npm run test # or yarn test
```

## Stack
- **Development**: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) ([Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/)) + [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- **Testing**: [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- **Deploy**: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Feel free to open an issue or let me know by any other medium (e-mail, twitter, etc...). I'd appreciate! ðŸ™Œ

This is open source so you can see how it was built. Please, do not create/publish your own portfolio as a _cheap copy_ of mine. That's rude.
